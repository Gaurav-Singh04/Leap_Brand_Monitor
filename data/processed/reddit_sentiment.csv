1m15sh6,Kindly recommend genuine admission consultants for top b-schools,"I am yet to give my GMAT and i‚Äôm aware that the application process can be started once i have a good score in hand. My plan was always to have a consultant to help me with the application process in an organised and non-chaotic way, but the amount of agencies and consultants in the market is making it difficult, so i‚Äôm researching and trying to find a genuine consultant to save some time in the later stage. 
I have received plenty of calls from Leapscholar, mim essay, leverage edu, Leapquest - to name a few. Most of their online reviews seem fake and sponsored, and all seem too good to be true. I don‚Äôt want to end up spending a hefty amount and get scammed in the end.

So if anyone here has had a good experience with any consultant or has any experience working with the ones i mentioned above, please help me. 

I‚Äôm targeting top b-schools in India, Europe and Singapore. 

Thanks! ",-1,0,-0.7,Negative,Reddit
1lf6geb,Has anyone used Leap for studying abroad? How was your experience?,"I am considering applying to universities abroad and have come across LeapScholar for IELTS coaching and guidance.

1keln01,I'm a graduating B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence with no work experience. How do I  start researching for universities abroad for a MiM degree for 2026?,"Hello,

I‚Äôm 21 years old and will be graduating with a [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) degree in Artificial Intelligence this September. While my undergraduate degree is highly technical, I‚Äôve realized that my strengths and interests lie more in management than in technical fields.

As a result, I‚Äôm planning to pursue a Master‚Äôs in Management (MiM), preferably in a European country. I understand that an MBA is not an option for me at this stage since my bachelor's degree and work experience don‚Äôt align with typical MBA requirements.

I‚Äôm currently working with a limited budget and have not yet taken any English language proficiency exams. I‚Äôve recently gained clarity about my career direction, which unfortunately means I'm a bit behind in the planning and application process.

I tried LeapScholar and even gotten counselling, but after reading several negative reviews, I‚Äôve decided not to proceed with their services. I‚Äôve also tried to research options on my own, but I‚Äôm struggling to find reliable and up-to-date information for 2026 admissions.

Could anyone guide me on how to begin my application journey, particularly for 2026 intakes in European MiM programs, and how to efficiently plan my timeline and preparations?

Thank you!

1j6fddz,Am i the only one who is very disappointed w leap scholar?,"I got their course for 5k for ielts course and it did work well for me even if there were LAGS in their answers where my answer was correct but they still put it wrong for the mock tests and even one of their customer services told me its possible but nvm that, so their customer care services called me MULTIPLE times for my abroad edu when i already told them every single time that i contacted another agency. So hust now a guy called me and asked me if i am planning for going abroad and i straight up told him im w another angency and like a toxic ex this mf is like why? And i told him wym why i already started my applicated w them and hes again like yeah ok why bcs we provide everything so why didnt u choose us so tell me why, and im like bro i dont have to give u any reason bcs its my wish and thats all the reason you need and this piece of crap just hung up on me. 

Another lady who called me before him asked me where im planning and just for the sake of it i told Australia and even after i told HER that im going for another agency she still continued yapping and check this out, she tried to convince me that Australia is a horrible option bcs they are rejecting 90% of indians and i knew all this was a bluff but i was shocked w how confidently she was trying to change my plans if i was gullible. So i told her 2 of my friends just went a week ago and she kept quiet and told me they got lucky, anyway then she just kept going on about nee zealand unis and kept going on and on and didnt even let me tell her to stop and then when i asked her to stop she just went like ‚Äúok so ill send ur profile to this unis in Australia?‚Äù And im like dude i didnt even ask for this what are you doing? And then when i was about to tell her that i chose another angecy she did the same thing that other mf did, hung up. 
And they also call from separate numbers so that we wont know they are calling from this leapscholar so i would recommend everyone to just report them as spam on true caller ",-1,0,-0.7,Negative,Reddit

Eduoptions was a bit costly and Leap was not that much costly so I started talking with Leapscholar counselor. 

Leap scholar counselor said that we guarantee if u are eligible for a university then we will definitely get u admitted in that university and are saying we will take care of everything. 

But to me it sounds so fishy like they just asked me my CGPA and what am I doing now and not much even did not asked any of my profile for ex. extra-curriculars. 

They even told me that If u have so much trust issues then u can drop out.

Due to my work I am not getting much time to do research on these topics faster :

1. How to make SOPs specifically for a university?

2. Applying for different universities who\`s criterion is different and the process of VPD and UNI Assist?

I wanted to share things that helped me score.

I booked my IELTS a bit early than I should have without any coaching or classes. As the test date got closer, I realised how tough it could be and got scared I might score a six or even a five. There were so many things to consider, like the format, speaking strategies, and advanced English vocabulary. 

For the last 2 days I used ChatGPT to prepare:

ChatGPT explained the structure of the IELTS test, including the four sections: Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking. This was a huge help in getting me familiar with what to expect. I used the **Ielts Speaking bot** available on ChatGPT **(pro or premium if you can get it through your office/friends or buy it)**. You can literally speak to the bot and practise for speaking section with instant corrections.

**ps:  I asked ChatGPT to give me synonyms for words to improve my vocabulary and score every time I wrote an essay. Helped a lot.  !! REALLY HELPED ME FIND AREAS OF IMPROVEMENTS**

Some links, very useful:  
[https://leapscholar.com/blog/updated-word-list-of-vocabulary-for-ielts/](https://leapscholar.com/blog/updated-word-list-of-vocabulary-for-ielts/)  -  Used this to keep some synonyms and new words in the back of my mind.  
[https://ielts.idp.com/prepare/ielts-test-preparation-material/academic](https://ielts.idp.com/prepare/ielts-test-preparation-material/academic)  - Official practice papers

Another major help was IELTS Advantage and Academic English Help [https://www.youtube.com/@Aehelp](https://www.youtube.com/@Aehelp)

Got my result today and I managed to score an 8 overall on my IELTS.

I just wanted to tell everyone that apart from online coaching and courses, many free resources can be helpful to boost your score.

Feel free to ask me any questions about my prep process or exam experience!

Not the best person for it but would not mind to be a speaking partner if needed.

I do not encourage any kind of quick preparation strategy but how you can improve to crack the 7 band.

This sub has been the most helpful place on the internet as well.

Also I had to use the washroom during the writing section cuz I had an emergency üö®üò≠

I haven't yet pinpointed my major but it's gonna be an engineering field or CS.ected and there were many discrepancies in the marking. Also, lmk if I stand a better chance with Carnegie Mellon or Texas A&M.  
I'm gonna apply to all of em tho and hope for the best.",-1,0,-0.7,Negative,Reddit

w0fmg6,Actually good credit cards for International Students? (Zolve vs Sable),"Does anybody know what an actually beneficial credit card for an incoming student is? I have heard a lot about Zolve recently, and some of their claims sound too good to be true, which makes me a little skeptical about the whole thing. Can anyone that has used Zolve or Sable (through Leapscholar) provide some insights on how the experience has been and if either of them is really worth it?

umcu4n,[Consultancies] Which consultancy is better than the rest?,"Hello, 
I assume that not all but many of us are applying to universities through a consultant because we either don't have time because of work or simply need guidance. 

I would love to get some input on these Consultancies, just so that not just me but others too get some idea of these consultancies. 
Choosing a consultancy is a huge task as it is connected to our future after all. 

The consultancies I am seeking info on are as follows-
1. IDP 
2. Edwise
3. Leverage edu
4. GEEBEE
5. Y-axis
6. Global opportunities 
7. LeapScholar

My_qualifications: BA & MA in psychology.
I wish to pursue Master of Counseling in Australia. 
I have received admits from USA too but after weighing the pros and cons I decided to go for Australia and thus now I'm wondering which consultancy to go for.

Feel free to text on PM too.
Eagerly waiting for responses. 
Thank you.",1,0,0.7,Positive,Reddit
