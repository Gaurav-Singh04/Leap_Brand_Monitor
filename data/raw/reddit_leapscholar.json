    "post_text": "I am yet to give my GMAT and i’m aware that the application process can be started once i have a good score in hand. My plan was always to have a consultant to help me with the application process in an organised and non-chaotic way, but the amount of agencies and consultants in the market is making it difficult, so i’m researching and trying to find a genuine consultant to save some time in the later stage. \nI have received plenty of calls from Leapscholar, mim essay, leverage edu, Leapquest - to name a few. Most of their online reviews seem fake and sponsored, and all seem too good to be true. I don’t want to end up spending a hefty amount and get scammed in the end.\n\nSo if anyone here has had a good experience with any consultant or has any experience working with the ones i mentioned above, please help me. \n\nI’m targeting top b-schools in India, Europe and Singapore. \n\nThanks!

So hust now a guy called me and asked me if i am planning for going abroad and i straight up told him im w another angency and like a toxic ex this mf is like why? And i told him wym why i already started my applicated w them and hes again like yeah ok why bcs we provide everything so why didnt u choose us so tell me why, and im like bro i dont have to give u any reason bcs its my wish and thats all the reason you need and this piece of crap just hung up on me. \n\nAnother lady who called me before him asked me where im planning and just for the sake of it i told Australia and even after i told HER that im going for another agency she still continued yapping and check this out, she tried to convince me that Australia is a horrible option bcs they are rejecting 90% of indians and i knew all this was a bluff but i was shocked w how confidently she was trying to change my plans if i was gullible. So i told her 2 of my friends just went a week ago and she kept quiet and told me they got lucky, anyway then she just kept going on about nee zealand unis and kept going on and on and didnt even let me tell her to stop and then when i asked her to stop she just went like “ok so ill send ur profile to this unis in Australia?” And im like dude i didnt even ask for this what are you doing? And then when i was about to tell her that i chose another angecy she did the same thing that other mf did, hung up. \nAnd they also call from separate numbers so that we wont know they are calling from this leapscholar so i would recommend everyone to just report them as spam on true caller ",

I was researching for universities and the whole process of Studying in Germany for this upcoming Winter Intake and since the process was taking a lot of time and there are many small small things that needs to be taken care of I came across some Consultancies like EduOptions and LeapScholar. Eduoptions was a bit costly and Leap was not that much costly so I started talking with Leapscholar counselor. \n\nLeap scholar counselor said that we guarantee if u are eligible for a university then we will definitely get u admitted in that university and are saying we will take care of everything. \n\nBut to me it sounds so fishy like they just asked me my CGPA and what am I doing now and not much even did not asked any of my profile for ex. extra-curriculars. \n\nThey even told me that If u have so much trust issues then u can drop out.\n\nDue to my work I am not getting much time to do research on these topics faster :\n\n1. How to make SOPs specifically for a university?\n\n2. Applying for different universities who\\`s criterion is different and the process of VPD and UNI Assist?\n\n3. Loan Process\n\n4. Accommodation\n\n5. Visa Application and what are small things included in that?\n\nSO FRIENDS, I am here to ask you guys what are your experiences when u went through Leap Scholar?",

Also very fishy about the documents required. I am yet to get my transcripts and they told me to just send in the grade reports.

They did not even search enough to know that the university I was applying to required answering a specific set of questions in a specific format and not a proper SOP.\n\nThey also did not inform me about any scholarships. After I got my offer letter, I was offered a scholarship from the university. But i also ressarched on my own and found 2 more where I applied on my own. But leap did not help me in this atall or tell me anything.\n\nThey also asked me if I had transcripts but did nlt elaborate further. They uploaded my gradesheets into the university portal bec they said Gradesheets/Transcripts.\nLater the universitu required the transcripts but mentioned them as \"Complete Degree Certificates without Scanning\". Leap did not elaborate on what these were and blamed me for not being aware. I had a friend applying for the universities he helped me in that.\n\nSo now Im at the visa process step, should I go forward with leap or not?",

As the test date got closer, I realised how tough it could be and got scared I might score a six or even a five. There were so many things to consider, like the format, speaking strategies, and advanced English vocabulary. \n\nFor the last 2 days I used ChatGPT to prepare:\n\nChatGPT explained the structure of the IELTS test, including the four sections: Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking. This was a huge help in getting me familiar with what to expect. I used the **Ielts Speaking bot** available on ChatGPT **(pro or premium if you can get it through your office/friends or buy it)**. You can literally speak to the bot and practise for speaking section with instant corrections.\n\n**ps:  I asked ChatGPT to give me synonyms for words to improve my vocabulary and score every time I wrote an essay. Helped a lot.  !! REALLY HELPED ME FIND AREAS OF IMPROVEMENTS**\n\nSome links, very useful:  \n[https://leapscholar.com/blog/updated-word-list-of-vocabulary-for-ielts/](https://leapscholar.com/blog/updated-word-list-of-vocabulary-for-ielts/)  -  Used this to keep some synonyms and new words in the back of my mind.  \n[https://ielts.idp.com/prepare/ielts-test-preparation-material/academic](https://ielts.idp.com/prepare/ielts-test-preparation-material/academic)  - Official practice papers\n\nAnother major help was IELTS Advantage and Academic English Help [https://www.youtube.com/@Aehelp](https://www.youtube.com/@Aehelp)\n\nGot my result today and I managed to score an 8 overall on my IELTS.\n\nI just wanted to tell everyone that apart from online coaching and courses, many free resources can be helpful to boost your score.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions about my prep process or exam experience!\n\nNot the best person for it but would not mind to be a speaking partner if needed.\n\nI do not encourage any kind of quick preparation strategy but how you can improve to crack the 7 band.\n\nThis sub has been the most helpful place on the internet as well.\n\nAlso I had to use the washroom during the writing section cuz I had an emergency 🚨😭\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sbbo17ftap8d1.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c60fa768a9e3098cb6e38a3da0299edd8e4ae8e\n\n",

So I already made a set of things I would share anyhow with them.\nA story with a friend \nA story with a relative \nA food item you like\n\nThese are normal set of things they'll cover in part one sometimes.\n\nFor me part 2 was to tell about one thing I would like to replace and in the pressured environment I thought I'll probably say my smartphone 😭 and then had to sort of create random set of stories around how my father gifted it to me and it's difficult to replace emotionally. Explains my score to be below 8.\n\nWhat happens is we try to stay attached to the topic but usually forget we can create the story around it as well. Creates enough content, for me that she had to stop me eventually 😂",

Simultaneously prepare for an English proficiency test.\n6. Check if standardized test scores are needed (GMAT/GRE) and prepare if applicable. \n7. Prepare a master SOP where you write a general essay and customise it for each college (or you can write a SOP from scratch for every college, it totally depends on your situation and preferences)\n8. Collect documents needed for application\n9. Create university account and apply\n10. Do the followup process post-admission. \n11. Apply for the visa\n12.

Indians (myself included) usually suffer in the speaking test, so practice with someone who can communicate in English (at a decent level). \n\nListening:\nThere are YouTube videos, I don't remember the name but there's a guy from Pakistan who uploads mock test videos, refer to those for listening exercises. \n\nReading: \n\nStart with reading English articles. Unless you have not read anything in English, I don't believe you'll struggle here.\n\nWriting: \nIf you have a laptop, use notepad to write (does not check for grammatical and spelling errors. Helps  gauge your actual status). \nIf you have someone who can check your writing work, ask them. If you don't use Grammarly or ChatGPT to proofread your spellings, punctuation, continuity and coherence.\n\nThis is something you can use to prepare for absolutely no cost. If you wish, enroll for a course maybe but I don't know much about it.\n\n\nAs for the consultants, i think it's better to do it yourself. Agents have nothing to loose and can very easily ruin your chances. I tried Leap for my journey and eventually had to do everything myself, after wasting MONTHS, and missed out on some great colleges due to the deadline.\n\nAT THE END OF THE DAY, ALWAYS REMEMBER. NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR FUTURE EXCEPT YOU.",

        "comment_text": "Coming to IELTS, the subreddit r/ielts has great resources which you can use for self study and practice. You can also join ielts courses online or coaching, it depends on how much confidence you have on your English. Some of my friends had taken ielts coaching and it turned out great for them, I had studied and practiced for like a few weeks on my own on the internet with yt videos and ielts practice websites. It's up to you.\n\nWell coming to the timeline of events I have a general gist of stuff you need to do but even I have some doubts on specifics...,\n\nFirst of all, make a list of all the courses you are interested in along with details like university, application period, etc. It requires researching and browsing a lot, but you will get an idea of what you require and how ti apply for them. Different courses have different methods of application and requirements, depending on the course, university, and country so make sure you have all the docs ready, which you can only know of when you research and browse through various courses.\n\nThe next step is procuring the required docs needed for application, like your study certificates, LORs, SOPs, etc, and tests like ielts and GRE and other docs like APS if required. It's upto the country and the courses, which you will get the idea like I said while you are browsing for courses. \n\nThen after getting your docs, all you need to do is wait for the application window. And if the application window starts, apply to the unis with the method the course / university wanted you to do with accordingly. Prep for aptitude tests if required, and apply and apply. \n\nNow afterwards all you can do is wait. Even I am a bit unaware of the specifics from here on, but generally, you can prep finances. Varies with country. Prepare you finances and be ready. Write a motivation letter meanwhile for visa, etc. The moment you get an admit letter from a uni, you need to run. Start your finance aspect, get health and travel insurance, apply to visa asap, look for accommodations. After getting your visa, book ticket, pack your stuff and voila!?\n\nAtleast that's what I believe are the final steps in a summary. I am open to answers and in-depth explanation of stuff after getting an admit letter as I have my doubts here.",

Cred has been losing money for a long time and they have really stopped providing rewards to users. The users signed up in the first place to get rewards for credit card payments. Now that that has dwindled to nothing, people will start moving away from Cred. The problem was that before making their main business successful and profitable, they put their feet in multiple other things, which all fell flat. Even Cred's lending platform was a decent idea, but I think the execution wasn't proper. Anyway, I have a completely bleak outlook on this company.",

I had my first counseling session with their counselor and he said \"You'll need a license\" when I told him that I am interested in going for Master of Counseling (Australia). I was shocked. He was so sure that i need license that he made me wait for 5 whole mins to research on it and when he came back he didn't even mention about the lic he said okay these 4 I have shortlisted for you. I asked him what about the lic thing you were checking for? He said ah no you don't need one. \n\nI had specifically told him I was interested in studying there and yet he didn't understand or got confused. He didn't even know much about Australia's mental health sector whereas he had one whole day to prep for this session. He was reluctant in answering anymore and said anymore questions then pls text. I said okay and just decided never to contact them again. \n\n>idp is the best one\n\nYeah they seem to be responsible. However, I have been told that they after a certain point the student has to be behind their backs to get the work done. Initially they are all nice is what I was told. So a bit of caution there. \n\nThanks for responding, at least now I don't feel like the experience I had with leapscholar was an exception. Also good to know you too had a good experience with IDP. Which country did you hire them for?",

I have taken the **leap Scholar Plus** subscription where they are giving 1:1 session with every student and free IELTS classes access and university selection and few more things for anyone aspiring to move abroad. I have no idea about this application and got it from **Youtube** ads. I wanted to know if it is legit to go with this for IELTS preparation and moving abroad or not?",
